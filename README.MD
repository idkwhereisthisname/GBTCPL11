## !IMPORTANT NOTICES!

1. The control panel items will always be in English (en-US)

2. Also no harm should be done to your PC, though I am not responsible for any damage.

3. Another thing, you should take ownership of the ```HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID``` hive on the registry before continuing with the install, to do so, right click, authorizations, advanced, owner should  be ```TrustedInstaller```, click change, type your user, select all the checkmarks, press ok, click the full access box, press ok, exit regedit, and youre good to go!, or you can run the script as [TrustedInstaller](https://winaero.com/download-execti-run-as-trustedinstaller/)

4. To get access to the system/about page in the control panel, use [ExplorerPatcher](https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher)

5. If you cant run the script as TrustedInstaller, run it as an administrator

6. Modify the ADD.bat file and place your acutal Windows username instead of "USERNAME"

7. One last thing, the folder has be unzipped in the downloads folder for it to work. And do not rename anything.

Testers are always welcome (I cant get a VM because my pc only has 8GB of RAM).
